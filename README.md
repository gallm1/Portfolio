    -- hearder with navigation bar
    -- links that
        -- a) soft scroll to specific spot on page

    -- Created 'Contact Me' section
        -- Created link to call my phone number

What i was not successful at:
    -- Creating multiple work projects and linking them to something
    -- CSS in general
        -- fine-tune class and id's
        -- positioning
        -- display, cascading-wise
        -- Felt like i had the @media screen portion figured out at one point, but don't think i made it through this one all the way

A Git hub repository has been created and cloned to my desktop.  Once the homework is finalized, I will push the repository back to Git hub, copy the link to the repository and the website and submit my homework.
